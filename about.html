        !About Me!
    </h1>
    <p>
        I started to get into coding for web development in 2020 during the covid-19 pandemic.  I found it to be very interesting and fun.  Though at that time, no one was hiring and i guess i lost the spark so to speak.  It was and is really cool that I am able to build a responsive website or a webpage from scratch.  I may even start asking my friends if I can build websites for them.  I also love music, dance, and Im trying to get into acting.  Sometimes when I am feeling inspired I like to write song lyrics.
